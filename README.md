I have conducted an in-depth analysis of the music store data utilizing the PostgreSQL database system. Despite employing a different database system, the query formulation remained consistent. 
The following is a brief summary of the analysis:

Data Source: The dataset used for analysis comprises various tables containing information on albums, artists, customers, sales, and tracks.

Objective: The primary aim of the analysis was to derive insights into customer behavior, sales performance, and product popularity within the music store.

Methodology: SQL queries were meticulously crafted to extract relevant information, employing JOINs, aggregations, and filtering conditions as required.
